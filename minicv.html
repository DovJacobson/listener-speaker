Jacobson’s explorations at the intersection of art and science yield a wide variety of digital games and related works. 

These works have been exhibited in underground galleries and nightclubs (Palladium, Limelight) and museums - including the Exploratorium, the Smithsonian, the Field Museum of Chicago, the Air Force Research Lab Museum, Museum of the Cherokee Indian (9/2023) and the Museum of the Moving Image.  

His computer illustrations have appeared in the NY Times Magazine, Byte and dozens of others. He worked with the science writer Carl Sagan to visualize black holes and with the science fiction writer Stanislaw Lem to animate that author’s Cyberiad fables using Nimble, an early commercial vector animation system he created.  His other linear works include Human Vectors (created on a Vectrex videogame), Universal Rhythms, Release 1.0 and 310 East 6th Street.

In 1981, Jacobson exhibited the art games Party Robot and Mandala at Phil Sander’s underground RYO Gallery in New York’s East Village, while creating the experimental Luna Tic and MELD for Time Warner. With Bill Ferster, he created an early series of popular computer animation tools, the Artwork suite, initially for his own use. 

Jacobson has directed several  popular-culture games including Dinotopia, Gettysburg, Pie Jackers, and I See Sue. His experimental games are often produced with research agencies such as the National Science Foundation: He made Enemy of Reason with the research arm of the US Intelligence Community, Brush Up with the National Institutes of Health and the algebra game sketch Tee Zero with DARPA.

Other games, such as Meba, Sneezin’s Greetings, and Afikomen have been distributed only privately.
