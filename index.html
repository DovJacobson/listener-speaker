                It's a real digital game for Game-Based Learning, and we make it from scratch - with no previous experience necessary. Just bring a laptop, if you can!
                Interactive stories are great for learning, so we use a simple engine called TWINE that is designed for story-oriented games. 
                You don't need any programming skills, just a clever imagination and the desire to have fun together.
                Twine is absoluely free: No cost. No registration. No download. No ads. No watermark, And a very gentle learning curve.`,

          blurb: `Art and Computers seem made for each other. But at the beginnig, they were completely alien worlds. In the late 1960's, young rule-breakers began to claim computers as the tools of art and to declare creative vision as a goal of computer science.
                 In this first-person review, we will take the journey from punch cards to virtual reality and beyond. We'll see shaky experiments in mainframe computer labs. We'll see art appear in 1983 in a tiny basement gallery on the Lower East Side, and see the same work acquired a few months ago by the Museum of Modern Art.`,

                Digital experience always becomes more immersive, year after year. We can lose track. Terms like Virtual Reality or Metaverse can be confusing since different people use and abuse them differntly.
                
                Let's break immersive technology down into its elements. These are human elements. Each is built on a feature of human perception.
                We can identify at least 14 different elements that are used by digital artists to create the sensation of immersion. We'll see how each one works - and how they work together.`,

          blurb: `Learning has many different objectives. We might memorize a fact, or develop a skill. We might build a habit or adopt an attitude.
                We learn each of these in different ways, using different media, even different senses.
                If you can classify your learning problem accurately, you can design a more effective learning experience.
                This talk describes the Five-Quadrant model.  The four corners of the model: Facts, Skills, Habits, Attitudes, are the quadrants of a 2D graph whose axes are Thought and Action.
                The magic fifth quadrant of learning is where Game Based Learning offers a shortcut to mastery.`,

          blurb: `Good learning games achieve their learning objectives.<br><br>Great games solve real life problems.<br><br>Let's study real world examples. Consider the problem of cybersecurity. We'll see how five companies looked at the issue of cybersecurity, but like blind men with an elephant, they each saw a different problem, chose a different learning objective and built a different game. The games were well made and they all, to varying degrees, acheived their learning goals.

          blurb: `To tell the truth - it was originally just an excuse to play with new game technology. It became an exploration of a child's perspective on toothbrushing and has matured into a campaign to save kids' teeth around the world. The game has flourished on many media, in many cultures and among many diverse neurotypes. <br><br> Best of all - independent random controlled trials show that it makes a clinical difference in oral health.`,

          subtitle: "Can museum visitors learn to be heros?",
          blurb: `Desmond Doss was a concientious objector who volunteered to serve in the Navy as a medical corpsman.
                He refused to carry - or even touch a weapon. But he still earned the Medal of Honor for his valor.
                One by one, he carried 76 wounded Marines to safety during their assault on Okinawa's Hacksaw Ridge.<br><br>

                Let's see how virtual reality might help museum visitors experience Doss's test of courage and principles.<br>

                That's the magic engine of Game Based Learning.
                But the dirty secret is that while we always learn from failure, we usually learn the wrong lesson.
                We learn that we're no good.
                Failure teaches us that we are no good at math, no good at sports, no good at remembering names.
                The designer of Game Based Learning needs to avoid this response, and instead stimulate the Mastery Response - in which failure challenges the player to try agan, and to do better. 
                Let's consider how to we design this Constructive Failure.`,

                But don't forget how much we learn with our curious hands.

                Eyes and ears capture light and sound, while hands capture mass and texture and temperature. But unlike the eyes and ears, the hands are not passive sensors.
                The hands are experimental, and explorational. We learn by doing. 
                This is the heart of great educational theorists like Maria Montessori and Seymour Papert. It is proven every day in thousands of Montessori-type classrooms.

                The moving hand is the root of game based learning. As designers, we must not allow fascinating images and engaging audio to distract us from the playful action at the core of game success.`,

                The good news is that constraints stimulate creativity.  Resistance is fertile! 
                Game designers can employ the improv motto of <i>"Yes, and..."</i>  to deliver games that are both supportive and entertaining. We can avoid both the cruelty of stereotypes and the deadly banality of politically correct corporate comittee work.`,
