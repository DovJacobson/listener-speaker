<h1>Dov Jacobson</h1> 

<p>Jacobson’s explorations at the intersection of art and science yield a wide variety of digital games and related works.</p>
  
<p>These works have been exhibited in galleries (RYO, Castelli), nightclubs (Palladium, Limelight) and museums (MoMA, Exploratorium, Smithsonian, Field Museum, Air Force Research Lab Museum, Museum of the Cherokee People, Museum of the Moving Image).</p>   
<p>His computer illustrations have appeared in the NY Times Magazine, Byte and dozens of others. He worked with the science writer Carl Sagan to visualize the black holes of <i>COSMOS</i> and with the science fiction writer Stanislaw Lem to animate Lem's <i>Cyberiad</i> fables using <i>Nimble</i>, an early commercial vector animation system he created.  His other linear works include <i>Human Vectors</i> (created on a Vectrex videogame), <i>Universal Rhythms</i>, <i>Release 1.0</i> and <i>310 East 6th Street</i>.</p> 
  
  <p>In 1981, Jacobson exhibited the art games <i>Party Robot</i> and <i>Mandala</i> at Phil Sander’s underground RYO Gallery in East Village of New York, while creating the experimental <i>Luna Tic</i> and <i>MELD</i> for Time Warner. With Bill Ferster, he created an early series of popular computer animation tools, the <i>Artwork</i> suite, initially for his own use.</p>  
<p>Jacobson has directed several popular-culture games including <i>Dinotopia</i>, <i>Gettysburg</i>, <i>Pie Jackers</i>, and <i>I See Sue</i>.</p>
  
<p>His experimental games are often produced with research agencies (National Science Foundation, NIH, DARPA, ONR, AFRL): He made <i>Enemy of Reason</i> with the research arm of the US Intelligence Community, <i>Brush Up</i> with the National Institutes of Health and the algebra game sketch <i>Tee Zero</i> with DARPA.</p>

<p>He is working now with tribal storytellers and scholars to build <i>Cherokee GeoVoices</i>.</p> 

  <p>Other games, such as <i>Meba</i>, <i>Happiometer (2025)</i>, <i>Sneezin’s Greetings</i>, and <i>Afikomen</i> are distributed only privately.</p> 


<p>Dov writes, speaks and listens worldwide. For three years he led a small game development adjunct faculty at NYU.</p>
